    <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length a paragraph is
        a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and
        coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.A paragraph is a series of sentences that are
        organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is
        longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where
        the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp
        its main points. Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series
        of brief examples
        or a single long illustration of a general point. It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a
        series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes and
        effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One
        of the most important of these is a topic sentence.</p>
