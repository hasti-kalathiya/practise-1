    <p><strong><i>“Hello, world!” program is a computer program that outputs or displays “Hello, world!” to a user. Being a
            very
            simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a
            programming
            language for a working program, and as such is often the very first program people write.</i></strong></p>
